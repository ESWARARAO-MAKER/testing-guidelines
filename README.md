# Testing Guidelines
This document outlines the best practices for **Testing Team** within our organization.

## Overview
Writing test cases during development is essential for maintaining code quality and ensuring that features and functionalities work as expected. Here’s how you can write test cases effectively:

## Things needs to consider while writing the test cases
### 1. Understand the Requirements:
  - Clearly understand what the feature or function is supposed to do. 
  - Identify edge cases and expected outcomes for different input scenarios. 

### 2. Choose the Right Testing Framework
 #### Select a suitable testing framework based on your project’s technology stack: 
- **JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Node.js):** Jest, Mocha, Cypress 
- **Java (Spring Boot):** JUnit, Mockito 
- **PHP (Laravel):** PHPUnit

 ### 3. Follow a Consistent Structure
#### Test cases should have a clear format:
- **Test Name:** Describes what the test is checking (e.g., should return 200 OK when the user is authenticated).
- **Setup:** Prepares the environment or input for the test.
- **Execution:** Calls the function or triggers the feature.
- **Assertion:** Verifies the result matches the expected outcome.
- **Teardown (optional):** Cleans up after the test if needed.

### Test case structure
**Here’s a comprehensive structure for documenting test cases:**

| Field  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Test Case ID  | Unique identifier (e.g., TC001, TC002).  |
| Title  | Brief description of the test (e.g., Verify login).  |
| Description  | Detailed explanation of the test's purpose. |
| Preconditions  | Any setup needed before running the test.  |
| Test Steps  | Step-by-step instructions for executing the test.  |
| Test Data  | Specific data required (e.g., user credentials).  |
| Expected Result  | Expected outcome if the test passes.  |
| Actual Result  | Record of what happens when the test is run.  |
| Status  | Pass/Fail status.  |
| Comments  | Additional observations or notes.  |
| Tested By  | Name of the tester.  |
| Date Executed  | The date the test was executed.  |

###  4. Write Unit Tests
- Focus on testing small, isolated pieces of code (e.g., functions or components).
- Ensure that each unit test covers a specific scenario and has clear expectations.
  
  ```
  // Example unit test using Jest
  
    describe('add function', () => {
      it('should return the sum of two numbers', () => {
        const result = add(2, 3);
        expect(result).toBe(5);
      });
    
      it('should return NaN when non-numeric values are passed', () => {
        const result = add('a', 3);
        expect(result).toBeNaN();
      });
    });

  ```

  
###  5. Write Integration Tests
- Test how different modules work together.
- Ensure the interactions between components or services function as intended.
  
  ```
  // Example integration test
  
    test('should retrieve user details when the user is authenticated', async () => {
      const response = await request(app).get('/api/user').set('Authorization', 'Bearer valid-token');
      expect(response.status).toBe(200);
      expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('username', 'john_doe');
    });

  ```

###  6. Write End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- Use tools like Cypress or Selenium for testing complete workflows in your application.
- Simulate user behavior and interactions.
  
  ```
  // Example E2E test with Cypress
  
    describe('User login flow', () => {
      it('should login and redirect to the dashboard', () => {
        cy.visit('/login');
        cy.get('input[name="username"]').type('testuser');
        cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('password123');
        cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
        cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
      });
    });
  
  ```

### 7. Use Mocks and Stubs Where Necessary
- Mock dependencies to isolate the behavior of the component or function under test.
- Stub external API calls to avoid making real network requests.

### 8. Run Tests Continuously
- Integrate your test suite with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.
- Use tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD.

### 9. Use Code Coverage Tools
- Ensure that your tests cover a high percentage of your code.
- Use tools like jest --coverage, Istanbul, or coverage reporting tools in other frameworks.
### 10. Document Test Cases
- Keep a log of test cases and document them for easy reference.
- Maintain descriptions, expected inputs/outputs, and scenarios in a shared space.
